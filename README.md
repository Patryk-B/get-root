# get-root

A simple package to consistently locate root directory of an project.

locates project's root dir via `process.env.npm_package_json` env var. Therefore enforces scripts to be run with `npm run <script>` command.

I created this package for my own use.

install with:

```sh
npm install --save @patryk-b/get-root
```
